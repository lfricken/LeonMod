Changes

UI
	All happiness-related UI elements given a complete overhaul - check em out!

Religion
	Holy Law - pop limiter now 250, was 200 
	Ceremonial Burial - now 14/14, was 8/8
	Hero Worship - now 25 GA/GG points (dep. on city location), and 100 faith/gap on conquest (was 60/60 faith/gap)
	Apostolic Tradition: now Food and Culture (was food and GAP)
	God-King: now +1 per 5 (was 6); Dagda is per 3
Buildings
	Removed some extraneous late-game happiness:
		Removed happiness on SDI building
		Removed happiness on stadium
		Removed happiness on Smithsonian
	Reduced free happiness on Notre Dame by 1 (was 2)
Happiness
	Empire Scaler
		Needs modifiers scale with the number of owned cities (6% for non-puppets, 3% for puppets)
		Empire needs modifiers can be reduced on a city-by-city basis:
			Walls, Castles, Arsenals reduce them by 5% in the City
			Military bases reduce them by 10%
			Chichen Itza reduces it by 10% globally
	Local Happiness
		Now, most happiness is a per-city mechanic. Each city generates happiness as well as unhappiness.
	Happiness: Can never be greater than your city population. Generated from the following
		Certain Buildings
		Luxuries (scales with city population, not 1:1 but gaining new luxuries does increase the potency of the scaling in a linear fashion, so expand!)
		Policies
		Handicap (applies per city)
		Religion (in some instances, such as building bonuses)
		Unhappiness: Can never be greater than your city population.

	Needs
		We have the same buckets (distress, poverty, illiteracy, boredom).
		Needs are calculated by a Global Median. Global Median = Median of (City Yield / Population). Needs are then modified by the following
			City Capital: +25%
			Empire: +6% for each city, +3% for each puppet.
			Tech: ~2% per tech unlocked (more like 1.33%, but eh)
			Pop: 2% per citizen in the city
		Buildings: Several buildings, and policies reduce your needs directly
			The Defense line of buildings reduces your empire modifier (locally)
			Non-wonder buildings reduce unhappiness from needs directly (they don't affect the modifier, but rather the outcome)
			Wonders and policies affect the modifiers, since they're global in function
		Your Need is compared to your yields. If your yields are lower, unhappiness is generated. It is 1:1 (1 deficit in yield per citizen = 1 unhappy from that yield)
		Specialist (urbanization) and Empire-wide unhappiness are now 'at the top' of the needs hierarchy.
			Specialists are 1 unhappiness each! They're more expensive for a city to maintain, so they're a bit more of an investment to consider. On the other hand, cities don't double dip on them in addition to needs unhappiness, so it averages out to a similar metric to before.
				Note that since puppets can run specialists, puppets do generate unhappiness from specialists (event though they don't get GPP, harsh!)
		Difficulty Handicaps are now applied to each city, and serve as a growth buffer for cities. The handicap starts at 5 for settler, down to 2 for Deity.
	Effects of City Happiness:
		City is Happy (more happiness than unhappiness): Growth bonus (currently 5% growth bonus per point of local happy above 0)
		City is Unhappy (more unhappiness than happiness): For every unhappiness you have above your happy number, you city suffers -10% growth and -10% production towards units
	Golden Ages
		Any 'excess' happiness (i.e. happiness above the city's unhappiness value) in a city is converted into GAP.
		Golden Age threshold and deltas modifier, now 400/2000 (was 750/2250)
	Global Happiness
		Global Happiness is the percentage of your empires citizens that are happy.
	Empire Happiness (sources of happiness not local to a city) - spread across your cities as an average (the remainder goes to the capital, so 6 happiness / 4 cities would leave 2 extra for capital).
		Sources:
			Some Religion happiness (peace happiness bonus, foreign followers bonus, num cities following bonus, happiness per pantheon, foreign spies bonus)
			Natural Wonders
			Minor Civ Happiness (mercantile)
			World Congress
			Vassals
			Events
			City Connections
	Empire Unhappiness (sources of unhappiness not local to a city) - spread across your cities as an average (the remainder goes to the capital, so 6 happiness / 4 cities would leave 2 extra for capital).
		Sources:
			War Weariness
			Public Opinion
	Unhappy Citizens
		In a city, Unhappy Citizens = Happiness - Unhappiness (if happiness is greater than unhappiness, this counts as zero for the city).
	Global Happiness
		Unhappy Citizens * 100 / Total Population
	Effects of Global Happiness:
		100%: No benefit, no penalty. Cities can gain local happiness/unhappiness modifiers normally.
		75%: No city can benefit from positive happiness for growth, and all cities suffer an additional -25% Growth/Production towards units. -10% combat penalty
		50%: No city can benefit from positive happiness for growth, and all cities suffer an additional -50% Growth/Production towards units. -20% combat penalty. Rebels can spawn!
		25%: No city can benefit from positive happiness for growth, and all cities suffer an additional -100% Growth/-75%Production towards units. -20% combat penalty. Rebels can spawn! Cities can secede!
	Pop Scaler now 200% (was 10%, changed formula slightly, so it's now 2% per 1 citizen)
	Puppet pop unhappiness scaler now 1:4 (has waffled a lot, but I've setttled on 1:4)
	Unhappiness per Specialist now 2:1 (2 specialist, 1 unhappy)
	Capital Modifier is 25% (was 15%)
	Tech base modifier is 125% (was 75%)
Projects
	New repeatable project- Public Works (base cost 300, era scaler cost 100, repeat cost 100)
		Unlocks at Machinery
		Reduces needs modifiers for distress, poverty, illiteracy, boredom, and religion by 10% in the city in which it is built
			This is a panic button - use wisely!
Buildings
	All non-wonder buildings that used to give % need modifier reductions now give flat unhappiness reductions
	Wonders give 10% reduction (was 5%)
		
Civs
	Venice - removed 20% GM bonus from Puppets, gave Venetian puppets the ability to generate happinesss
Policies
	Progress - Equality now gives +1 local happiness for every 8 citizens in a city (was +1 per 12 global)
	Divine Right - 25% of city's produced happiness (not delta!) converts to culture every turn.
	
Improvements
	Landmark: now gives +1 happiness to every city (was +2 to capital alone)
