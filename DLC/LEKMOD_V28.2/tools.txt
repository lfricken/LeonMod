===CivDdsUnpacker===
====================
Unpacks dds files from civ that have already been exported.
They start in a jumbled format. This unjumbles them.

===UNIFDEF===
=============
// Removes all instances of #ifdef XYZ optionally choosing whether to treat XYZ as true or false
// You need to add the unifdef path to your windows environment variable path.

// removes AUI_CONSTIFY assuming AUI_CONSTIFY is true
// -UAUI_CONSTIFY would remove assuming it is false
unifdef -DAUI_CONSTIFY CvTradeClasses.cpp > CvTradeClasses.cpp

// echos files in a folder
for /f %f in ('dir /b "%cd%"') do echo temp/%f
for /f %f in "%cd%" do echo %f

// undefs all files in a folder and writes them to a temp folder
// you can't just write back to the same file for some reason
for /f %f in ('dir /b "%cd%"') do unifdef -DAUI_CONSTIFY %f > temp/%f
